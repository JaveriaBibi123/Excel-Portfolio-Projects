The dashboard is structured around 16 key HR metrics, grouped by themes of employee performance, satisfaction, and organizational health:

ðŸš¹ Workforce Overview
Headcount: 36 employees currently

90-Day Quit Rate: 9% â€“ reflecting early-stage employee turnover

Acceptance Ratio: 31% â€“ shows selectivity or offer acceptance rate

ðŸ§  Learning & Development
Training Effectiveness: 77% â€“ a strong indicator of learning success

Internal Promotion Rate: 8% â€“ lower than ideal, may suggest stagnation

ðŸ‘¥ Engagement & Satisfaction
Engagement Index: 52% (â†“24% vs. previous month) â€“ indicates declining employee engagement

Satisfaction Index: 87% (â†“5%) â€“ generally positive but slightly decreased

Benefits Satisfaction: 43% (â†‘39%) â€“ strong improvement in perception of benefits

ðŸ’¤ Absenteeism
Absence Rate: 9% (â†‘22%) â€“ may require action or further analysis

Absence Cost: $1,336 (â†“14%) â€“ reduction in financial impact of absenteeism

ðŸ›  Productivity & Quality
Productivity Rate: 74% (â†“12%) â€“ suggests a dip in output

Quality of Hire: 46% (â†“12%) â€“ potential concern in recruitment effectiveness

ðŸ’¼ Organizational Health
Turnover Rate: 12% (â†‘35%) â€“ shows a significant increase, a red flag for retention

Net Promoter Score (NPS): 8 (â†“20%) â€“ indicates a decrease in employee advocacy or satisfaction with the company

ðŸ“ˆ Story the Dashboard Tells
This dashboard tells the story of a mid-sized organization undergoing shifts in workforce dynamics. While satisfaction scores remain relatively high, other KPIs signal emerging issues:

Engagement, NPS, and productivity are all declining, possibly linked to reduced training quality, low internal mobility, or increased absenteeism.

Turnover has spiked by 35%, a key signal of dissatisfaction or external competition.

Benefits satisfaction has improved significantly, showing that recent benefit adjustments may be well-received.

A moderate headcount of 36 and a 31% acceptance rate suggest a selective hiring approach, though quality of hire remains a challenge.

Overall, the dashboard reveals that while employees are generally satisfied, they are becoming less engaged and more likely to leaveâ€”prompting HR to refocus on retention, training, and internal growth opportunities.
