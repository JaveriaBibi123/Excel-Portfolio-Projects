üß† Insights & Storytelling
The dashboard tells the story of a channel experiencing a growth in visibility but facing challenges in monetization and viewer retention:

Despite significant growth in views and retention, engagement and revenue are declining. This may imply that new viewers aren't interacting or converting into loyal subscribers.

The spike in views is driven by Search, suggesting that content is discoverable but might not be sticky or compelling enough to retain users long-term.

A small drop in average watch time and views per viewer, combined with a dip in engagement, points toward shorter content relevance or lack of emotional connection.

Revenue loss, despite high monetized playbacks, could indicate reduced ad rates or regional shifts in viewer demographics.
